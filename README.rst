This repository contains `Ansible <https://www.ansible.com/>`_ roles and
playbooks for `OpenShift <https://www.openshift.com/>`_ for automating
the interactions with the OpenShift operators under the responsibility
Red Hat PSAP team.

  * Performance & Latency Sensitive Application Platform

To date, this includes:

- NVIDIA GPU Operator (most of the repository relates to the
  deployment, testing and interactions with this operator)
- the Special Resource Operator (deployment and testing currently under
  development)
- the Node Feature Discovery
- the Node Tuning Operator


Dependencies
------------

Requirements:

- ``ansible`` (`>= 2.9.5`), ``yq``, ``jq``

.. code-block:: shell

    pip3 install yq ansible==2.9.*
    dnf install jq


- OpenShift Client (``oc``)

.. code-block:: shell

    wget --quiet https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/x86_64/clients/ocp/latest/openshift-client-linux.tar.gz
    tar xf openshift-client-linux.tar.gz oc


- An OpenShift cluster accessible with ``$KUBECONFIG`` properly set

.. code-block:: shell

    oc version # fails if the cluster is not reachable


Prow CI
-------

The original purpose of this repository was to perform nightly testing
of the OpenShift Operators under responsibility.

This CI testing is performed by OpenShift PROW instance. Is is
controlled by the configuration files located in these directories:

* https://github.com/openshift/release/tree/master/ci-operator/config/openshift-psap/ci-artifacts
* https://github.com/openshift/release/tree/master/ci-operator/jobs/openshift-psap/ci-artifacts

The main configuration is written in the ``config`` directory, and
``jobs`` are then generated with ``make ci-operator-config
jobs``. Secondary configuration options can then be modified in the
``jobs`` directory.


The Prow CI jobs run in an OpenShift Pod. The `ContainerFile
<build/Dockerfile>`_ is used to build their base-image, and the
``run`` (``build/root/usr/local/bin/run``) file is used as entrypoint.

From this entrypoint, we trigger the different high-level tasks of the
operator end-to-end testing, eg:

* ``run gpu-operator test-master-branch``
* ``run gpu-operator test-operatorhub``
* ``run gpu-operator validate-deployment``
* ``run gpu-operator undeploy-operatorhub``
* ``run cluster upgrade``

These different high-level tasks rely on the toolbox scripts to
automate the deployment of the required dependencies (eg, the NFD
operator), the deployment of the operator from its published manifest
or from its development repository and its non-regression testing.

CI Dashboard
------------

The artifacts generated during the nightly CI testing are reused to
plot a "testing dashboard" that gives an overview of the last days of
testing. The generation of this page is performed by the
`ci-dashboard <https://github.com/openshift-psap/ci-dashboard/>`_
repository.

Currently, only the GPU Operator results are exposed in
`this dashboard <https://openshift-psap.github.io/ci-dashboard/gpu-operator_daily-matrix.html>`_:

PSAP Operators Toolbox
----------------------

The PSAP Operators Toolbox is a set of tools, originally written for
CI automation, but that appeared to be useful for a broader scope. It
automates different operations on OpenShift clusters and operators
revolving around PSAP activities: entitlement, scale-up of GPU nodes,
deployment of the NFD, SRO and NVIDIA GPU Operators, but also their
configuration and troubleshooting.


The functionalities of the toolbox commands is described in the
`documentation page <https://openshift-psap.github.io/ci-artifacts/index.html#psap-toolbox>`_.
